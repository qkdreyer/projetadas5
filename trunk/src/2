The general conclusion of the workshop participants is that undergraduate computer science majors need
to acquire mathematical maturity and skills, especially in discrete mathematics, early in their college education.
The following topics are likely to be used in the first three courses for computer science majors:
logical reasoning, functions, relations, sets, mathematical induction, combinatorics, finite probability,
asymptotic notation, recurrence/difference equations, graphs, trees, and number systems. Ultimately, calculus,
linear algebra, and statistics topics are also needed, but none earlier than discrete mathematics.
Thus, such a discrete mathematics course should be offered in the first semester and the prerequisite expectations
and conceptual level should be the same as for the Calculus I course offered to mathematics and
science majors. Our detailed recommendations respond directly to the series of questions of direct relevance
to the CUPM Initiative posed by the Workshop hosts.
